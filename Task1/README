Purpose
This project is a simple Library Management System built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It helps manage books by allowing users to:
Add new books
Issue books to people
Return books
Check if a book is available

Key Components

1. Book Class
Stores basic book details:
Title
Author
Serial Number (SNo)

2. Issueable Interface
Defines essential actions for a book:
bookIssue(String user) – Issue the book
returningTheBook() – Return the book
isAvailable() – Check if available

3. LibraryBook Class
Extends Book and implements Issueable.
Tracks whether the book is issued and keeps the user who borrowed it.

4. Library Class
Manages a collection of LibraryBook objects and provides methods to:
Add books
Search books by Serial Number

5. Main Class
Provides a console-based menu where users can:
Add a new book
Issue a book by entering its number and user
Return a book
Check availability
All actions show helpful success or error messages.

6. LibraryBookTest (JUnit Tests)
Tests important cases:
Issuing a book successfully
Returning a book successfully
Prevent issuing a book already issued
Prevent returning a book not issued
Check if a new book is available by default

SUMMARY
This project demonstrates OOP concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling in a clear, practical way.
It’s a great starting point for learning how to build simple real-world applications using Java.
